### Today was my first day back at the gym in 5 months!

I tore my ACL and had ACL replacement surgery on November 23rd 2016,
so have been rehabbing my knee ever since. I've been kicking my own ass in
physical therapy for 5 months straight, 2 times a week now, and can finally jog
again.

I went on a treadmill and ran for an entire 30 minutes, which felt amazing. It's
amazing how fantastic running feels to me now, when it was the one exercise I
loathed in the past. Not to mention getting to lift heavy weights again.
It feels amazing to be back, and i'm going to compliment it with _beautiful_
healthy meals as pictured here. Here's to being back!
