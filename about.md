### My name is Jason Tyler Dorn and i'm in *love* with food and tech.

I am a software engineer currently residing in the beautiful city of
San Francisco, California.
Everyday i'm cooking and programming, and *love* it. I'm currently teaching myself
how to play guitar and trying to get fit again. I tore my ACL and had ACL
replacement surgery on November 23rd 2016, so have been rehabbing my knee ever 
since.

I also love going to music festivals. Music festivals
are typically my favorite time of year, particularly going to _Outside Lands_.
Nothing makes me happier than spending time with my friends and loved ones
while dancing around and listening to music. Playing video games is one of
my favorite things to do as well, but unfortunately can't find as much time
for it as i'd like. I'm currently playing _Zelda Breath of the Wild_
